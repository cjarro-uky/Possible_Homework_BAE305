# Possible_Homework_BAE305
Hey Dr. Dvorak,
I was working on trying something interesting for the homework and I asked the following to ChatGPT:

1. How can I do in python to locate an object in a map having latitude and longitude?
2. Can I locate two objects?
3. Can I annotate a time format string onto these types of maps?

I think this could be an interesting homework. It is at first sight an impossible task for a 
beginner. With ChatGPT I was able to do it in less than 20 minutes.
They have to install a package, and the answer from ChatGPT does not run, they have to ask
anaconda assistant how to show an html in the jupyter environment.
